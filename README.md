# video-generator
This is tested in macOS Mojave `10.14.6 (18G87)`

## Installation
Please make sure you install `FFMPEG` library in your machine before using this gem.


```bash
    gem install erika   

```
## Requirements
### FFMPEG
A complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video.
#### MacOSx
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

#### Ubuntu
```bash
apt-get install ffmpeg
```


## Usage
To compile images in `~/pictures/birthday`, you need to make sure files are named in proper order. 
I recommend you to prefix the files with number like
```
- 0 My first birthday.jpg
- 1 My second birthday.jpg
- 2 My second birthday.jpg
- 3 My third birthday.jpg
```

single command to compile
```bash
cd ~/pictures

erika g -s birthday -o mybirthday.mp4 

# This will generate video called `mybirthday.mp4`
```

## Options
```bash
î‚° erika help g
Usage:
  erika g

Options:
  -o, [--output=OUTPUT]                            # Output path; where to generate output movie
  -s, [--source=SOURCE]                            # Input path; folder path where the images are located
  -a, [--audio=AUDIO]                              # Audio path; the path to bg audio
  -t, [--transition-duration=TRANSITION_DURATION]  # Transition animation duration between two images
  -S, [--slide-duration=SLIDE_DURATION]            # Slide duration between two images

Generate movie

```
Example:-

```ruby
 erika g -s happy -S=5 -t=4 -o=opt/mymovie.mp4

```

## How Slide Animation is implemented
Creating intermediate mpeg's for each image and then concatenate them
 all into a `video`. 
 
**For example**, say you have `5` images; you would run this for each one of the 
 images to create the intermediate mpeg's with a fade in at the beginning and a fade out at the end.

```bash
ffmpeg -y -loop 1 -i <your-image> -vf "fade=t=in:st=0:d=0.5,fade=t=out:st=4.5:d=0.5" -c:v mpeg2video -t 5 -q:v 1 image-1.mpeg
```

where `t` is the duration, or time, of each image. Once you have all of these mpeg's, you use
 ffmpeg's concat command to combine them all into an `mp4`.

```bash
ffmpeg -y -i image-1.mpeg -i image-2.mpeg -i image-3.mpeg -i image-4.mpeg -i image-5.mpeg -filter_complex '[0:v][1:v][2:v][3:v][4:v] concat=n=5:v=1 [v]' -map '[v]' -c:v libx264 -s 1280x720 -aspect 16:9 -q:v 1 -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4
```
